This page is a demo for a friend's business. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

## Move Theater Site
This page is a home page example for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
